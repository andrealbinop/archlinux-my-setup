My Setup for [ArchLinux](https://www.archlinux.org/)
==========

Scripts, guides and everything needed to properly configure a linux operating system designed for software development. This version is based on [ArchLinux](https://www.archlinux.org/), and is not designed for unattended installations. This project is licensed under [MIT](LICENSE).

As for now, there are no features properly implemented! It's currently under development, maybe you find something in other branches of this project.

**Important:** It's a good practice to test the installation procedure in a virtualized environment before going to the real thing.
